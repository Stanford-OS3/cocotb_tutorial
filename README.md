<h2>
  Installing cocotb
</h2>
<p>
  run the following command: <br>
  <code>
    pip install cocotb
  </code>
</p>

<h2> 
  Installing Verilator 
</h2>
<p> 
  you don't have to use verilator, but if you are, you may encounter issues with the installation process.
  I used <a href="https://k0nze.dev/posts/verilog-apple-silicon/"> this link </a> to give a rough idea of
  requirements/installation. However, I think <a href="https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html"> this link </a>   is better for general-use. Just use a combination of both.
