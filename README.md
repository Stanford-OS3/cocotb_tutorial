<h2> Installing Verilator </h2>
<p> 
  you don't have to use verilator, but if you are, you may encounter issues with the installation process.
  I used <a href="https://k0nze.dev/posts/verilog-apple-silicon/"> this link </a> to give a rough idea of
  requirements/installation. However, I think <a href="https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html"> this link </a>   is better for general-use. Just use a combination of both.
